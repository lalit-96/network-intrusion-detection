# network-intrusion-detection



Network Intrusion detection (NDS) is the immerging field of network security due to its importance for modern information technology infrastructure. In this paper clustering based classification model(CCM) is used to detect anomalies in network traffic and packets.
The Proposed intrusion detection system is trained and tested on NSL-KDD dataset which is an updated dataset from KDDCup 1999 which is considered as a benchmark for an intrusion detection system. Performance of machine learning models is compared using various comparison measure, including precision and recall.
